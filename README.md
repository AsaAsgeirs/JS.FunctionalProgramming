# JS - Functional Programming

I created a react movie application, were you can search for a movie and save them in Favourites.
- Got the movie data from OMDb API (the open movie database).
- You can search for a movie in the right top corner, in the input field ,,Type to Search..."
- You can save your favourite movies in localStorage by hovering over the movie cover and clicking ,,Add to Favourites"
- To remove a movie from Favourite hover over and click on ,,Remove from Favourites"

I followed a tutorial on youtube, but when I finished the code from the tutorial the code didn't work as it was supposed to, I rechecked my code next to the tutorial code and didn't see any mistakes. I was able to fixed them myself which I was pretty proud of to manage! :)

- I used Postman to check if the API wasn't working as it should and changed the key to a search to get a search Array.
- I used bootstap for the layout, mobile flexbox grid.
- Style it more in css so it would not be exactly the same as the tutorial.

I hope you like it :)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
